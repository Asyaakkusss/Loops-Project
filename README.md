# Loops-Project
Performed functions that a word processor would need (eg, deleting words, counting the number of words, justifying paragraphs) using loops
The first average class takes a single-dimension array and returns the average of the values within it. The second average class takes a two-dimensional array and
returns the average of the values within it. countWords counts the number of words in an input. the truncate method truncates an input sentence at a word boundary so 
that it does not go beyond the sepcified number of words. padString adds as many spaces as necessary to an input as the user wants and specifies in the int parameter. 
prettyPrint justifies the input provided to it.
